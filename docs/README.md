#Pilates Gold

Our app has been purely made with React Native and has no backend currently.

### Frontend:
React Native with expo is managing the frontend in our app.
It supports iOS, Android and web.


### Data serving:
All the data is served by Firebase which is processed and shown by our frontend. 
It should be very easy to link firebase by updating the firebaseConfig.js file in the app folder.
Firestore is being used to store assets shown in our application.

For more information about how to navigate firebase: 
https://firebase.google.com/docs

### Testing:
Jest snapshot testing has been done for the UI components. Since there is not much logic in the app,
there is not much unit testing that has been done for that.

### Team:
